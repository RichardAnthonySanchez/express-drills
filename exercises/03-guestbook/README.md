3. Guestbook (Handling Requests)
   Create a simple form on your page (e.g., “enter your adventurer name”).

On submission:

Send a POST request to /guestbook.

Save names in memory (just an array).

Show the list of all names on another route (/players).

👉 Skill gained: GET vs POST, reading input, sending back data.
(Very similar to how a VTT manages “users in a game.”)
