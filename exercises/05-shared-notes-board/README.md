5. Shared Notes Board (Simple Realtime Feeling)
   Create a /notes page where players can post short notes.

Store notes in memory (array of objects).

Every time a new note is submitted, the page reloads and shows the full list.

Bonus: add timestamps to entries.

ðŸ‘‰ Skill gained: Simulating shared state between multiple clients.
(This mimics Foundryâ€™s concept of syncing worlds/maps.)
