# Express Drills

A collection of small projects to practice building servers with **Node.js** and **Express**.  
Each exercise focuses on a core concept youâ€™ll need to run a local Node server (like for hosting tools such as Foundry VTT).

## ðŸ“… Study Plan

These exercises are designed to be tackled one per day (about 1 hour each).  
[Google Calendar import file](./node_express_study_plan.csv) is included to keep you on track.

1. **Hello, Neighbor** â€“ basic Express server, respond with "Hello World!"
2. **The Local CafÃ©** â€“ serve static HTML, CSS, and JS files
3. **Guestbook** â€“ handle GET/POST requests and store names
4. **Dice Roller API** â€“ build a mini JSON API for dice rolls
5. **Shared Notes Board** â€“ simulate shared state between clients
6. **The Dungeon Door** â€“ add simple access control
7. **The Real Test** â€“ run the server on LAN and connect multiple devices
